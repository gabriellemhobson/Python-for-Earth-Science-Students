Save an image of that location by taking a screenshot (if you are using the browser) or by clicking `File > Save > Save Image` to save an image (if you are using Google Earth Pro on your computer). Make a note of the location, the data source (check the bottom bar of the Google Earth interface to find data source info), and the imagery date. Report this information in your answer. \n",
